> Attention - Canvas for Adding Context

**Note:** *Technical details are simplified or omitted for intuitive understanding.*

**Note:** *I use the term "bare-bone token" to refer to raw, initial, base token embedding. It's not a technical term. It's just for intuitive understanding.*

Attention mechanisms are often explained with technical jargon that obscures rather than clarifies. Let me avoid that trap and give you something you can actually use. The following explanation strips away the math to focus on what attention really does.

But here's the key insight: even with simplification, truly understanding attention mechanisms requires engaging your intuition. 

Try the following simple explanation. Can you understand it in one-shot?

Attention is the core operation in Transformer models such as LLMs.

1. **Query (Q)** – what the current token is *asking for* in the rest of the sequence  
2. **Key (K)** – what each token *offers* to other tokens  
3. **Value (V)** – the actual information carried by each token  

---

Ask your LLMs to simplify the attention mechanism, and that's often as simple as they can go. Still confusing.

Sounds awful. Just ritual simplification. 

But how about this?

In a nutshell, the attention mechanism is an attempt to get the context, or to get the full picture, from the context of the prompt. Every token (just treat it as a word for understanding this for now) shifts in meaning and nuance depending on the context of the prompt. It's what human languages are about, in the first place.

Just know that the attention mechanism is a way of weighting the contribution of each token (or word) to another specific token to adjust the meaning and nuance of the token. Simply put, the attention mechanism is *to get the context.*

**Remember this:**

*Out of context, every damn word loses its meaning.*

'Woman'? It's just a word without context. 'A beautiful woman'? Now we're talking.

Those modifiers? Their essential purpose is to narrow the meaning of the word: woman → a woman → a beautiful woman → a very beautiful woman → the most beautiful woman in the world. 

The more modifiers we add, the more specific and nuanced the meaning becomes. This is precisely what context accomplishes - it shapes and refines the semantic understanding of each token within the broader linguistic framework.

'Woman' practically doesn't mean anything. It's just a keyword label in your dictionary.

You get the point.

## Attention calculation

- Compute similarity scores between Q and K vectors (dot product)  
- Scale the scores by √d<sub>k</sub> and normalize with soft-max  
- Use the normalized scores to form a weighted sum of V vectors  

---

I know, we're back to messy technical details. Just bear with me. You're progressing, I promise. This part is important for understanding how attention actually works in practice. This lets tokens selectively focus on the most relevant parts of the input, acting as a soft, differentiable memory lookup.

**Intuition**

What this means in plain English is that when processing the token 'woman' in the sentence "There was a beautiful woman with an ugly cat," the attention mechanism gives higher weight to 'beautiful' than to 'ugly' because 'beautiful' directly modifies 'woman' while 'ugly' modifies 'cat'. This contextual weighting ensures the model understands that the woman is beautiful, not ugly.

**A shocker for non-tech people:** 

Every token in the model's vocabulary (its known words and word pieces) is considered when predicting the next token. The probabilities assigned to all possible next tokens must sum to 1, with the most likely candidate receiving the highest weight. 

You'll frequently encounter 'softmax' in AI literature. It's the mathematical function that converts raw scores into a probability distribution where all values sum to 1. It sits at the final layer of the LLM's neural network, transforming the model's internal calculations into those token probabilities.

For example:

"There was a beautiful woman with an ugly ____." 

When predicting what comes next, the model evaluates all previous tokens (there, was, a, beautiful, woman, with, an, ugly) to calculate weights for every possible continuation in its vocabulary. While 'cat' might receive the highest probability, other options remain possible:

- cat: 0.42
- dog: 0.28
- creature: 0.09
- hat: 0.05
- man: 0.04
- face: 0.03
- personality: 0.02
- ...
- the: 0.0002
- with: 0.0001
- since: 0.00005

...and thousands or even tens of thousands more tokens with increasingly tiny probabilities depending on the vocabulary size.

I know it's a contrived example, but it's just to help you understand the concept.  

This explains why certain completions feel "wrong" to us. The sentence "There was a beautiful woman with an ugly since" immediately strikes us as grammatically incorrect—and the model recognizes this too, assigning negligible probability to 'since' in this context. However, if the broader context suggested intentional grammatical errors, the model might assign higher probability to otherwise unlikely tokens by attending to all contextual information in the prompt.

Non-tech, non-stats people often find it hard to wrap their heads around this concept: all weights sum up to 1 even when considering a huge vocabulary like tens of thousands of tokens. They all get a chance to be weighted.

If the concept still confuses you, consider your own thinking process when writing. When choosing the next word in a sentence, you're unconsciously weighing many possible options based on what sounds right in context. The difference? An LLM explicitly considers its entire vocabulary (tens of thousands of tokens), assigning probability weights to each one. If humans could consciously evaluate every possible word with perfect recall, we'd essentially be performing the same operation as an LLM's attention mechanism—just with better reasoning. This parallel between human language intuition and machine probability distribution is what makes modern LLMs feel so natural in their outputs.

## Q, K, V components

Now, let's dive deeper into the Query, Key, Value (Q, K, V) components that form the heart of the attention mechanism introduced in the landmark "Attention is all you need" paper. This mechanism is what enables transformers to capture contextual relationships between tokens. 

Don't worry. I'll throw the techy-sounding definitions first, then provide the intuition to help it make sense.

The Q, K, V framework is essentially a sophisticated information retrieval system:

1. **Query (Q)** vectors represent what the current token is "searching for" in the context
2. **Key (K)** vectors are what each token in the sequence "offers" as potentially relevant information
3. **Value (V)** vectors contain the actual content or information that gets weighted and aggregated

Wait, vectors? Why the sudden shift in terminology?

Yes, vectors. 

Back in the day, when AI was just a distant sci-fi fancy concept, we used simple numbers to represent words. But we soon realized, then how do we deal with all that context? Subtlety and nuance? 

That's where vectors come in. It's like an adjustable texture of the word. A vector can be multidimensional, and each dimension can be adjusted to represent a different aspect of the word. In a nutshell, more data is used to represent the word, and that's how we can get more context.  

Still confused? Think of vectors as high-resolution images that capture subtle details, while simple numbers are like low-resolution pixelated sprites from 80s video games: 8k vs 2bit b/w for the same image. Which would you use to represent a word? You get the point.

However, high-resolution representations come with a significant computational cost. But that's a topic beyond the scope of this guide - let's return to understanding the core attention mechanism. (Just remember this for now: this is why we use GPUs for AI. CPUs are really bad at handling high-dimensional vector operations.)

When a token processes its context, it uses its Query vector to "ask questions" of all other tokens' Key vectors. The compatibility between Q and K determines how much attention to pay to each token's Value vector.

See? All these vectors for every token in the vocabulary. Massive amount of data, massive amount of context, massive amount of computation required: or in today's AI lingo, compute. (Compute as a noun, carries the connotation of all the relevant resources, not just computational power.)

Let's resort back to the intuition again before your brain *compute* overloads. 

**Intuition**

Think of attention as adding context to stripped-down bare-bone, vectorized tokens: those keywords appearing in any dictionary. Those keywords alone don't carry any context, right? You have to put them in a sentence to make sense.

Suppose the current token is **"creature."** Q is effectively asking, *"What creature?"*, K comes from every other token that might provide the answer, and V holds each token's information.

```
Full prompt: "a very lovely creature"
```

So the 'lovely' token is answering the question, *"What creature?"* - it's saying "here, here, 'lovely'!" That's what's happening here.

Because "creature" is preceded by "very lovely," attention puts more weight on those adjectives, so downstream layers treat "creature" as *lovely* rather than, say, *dangerous*.  

Internally, the model doesn't change the original embedding; it produces a **contextualised** vector—embedding plus weighted context—that later layers use.

Again, simply put, the attention mechanism adds context to the bare-bone tokens by weighting their relationships with other tokens in the sequence.

Under the hood, the token's embedding shifts through this process:

```
embedding = embedding + context
```

In fact, the embedding keeps changing through the layers until it becomes fully *textured* with the context. I'm referring to the interim embedding here, not the original bare-bone token embedding.

I wouldn't even try asking my model to create even the simplest example of the vector changing here. Why? They wouldn't know how to simplify that much for intuitive understanding involving floating point numbers with lots of decimal places.  

Here's my intuitive example. Know that it's *simplified* for clarity, but it should help you visualize what's happening:

```python
# A token embedding is just a list of numbers representing the word
bare_token_embedding_for_creature = [0.123, 0.235, -0.314, 0.452, -0.187]  # truncated for clarity
```

During the attention mechanism, for each token position:

```python
# Each token has its own Q, K, V vectors derived from the original embedding
Q = [0.952, 0.123, 0.443]  # What am I looking for?
K = [0.824, -0.234, 0.385]  # What I have to offer
V = [0.734, -0.345, 0.912]  # The actual information I carry

# Simple attention score calculation (greatly simplified!)
attention_score = Q • K  # Dot product measures similarity
attention_weight = softmax(attention_score)  # Convert to probability distribution
weighted_value = attention_weight * V  # Apply the weight to the value
```

After calculating this for all relevant tokens and combining the results:

```python
# The original embedding gets enriched with contextual information
contextualized_embedding_for_creature = [0.543, -0.235, 0.823, 0.612, -0.341]  # transformed by attention
```

And all those decimal numbers you see? They represent the actual information encoded in the embedding space. In practice, these values often get rounded or compressed - that's where terms like "precision" and "quantization" come into play. These techniques reduce memory requirements and speed up computation, sometimes with minimal accuracy loss. Again, beyond the scope of this guide. 

Your brain compute might have been overloaded by now. If so, just remember this:

The bare-bone token embedding is like a blank canvas. The attention mechanism is like a paintbrush that adds context to the canvas. The more context you add, the more textured the canvas becomes. However, the bare-bone token embedding coming from the vocabulary never changes. Only the textured final result navigating through the neural networks of the model does.

Congratulations! You've just grasped the most important and confusing concept in modern AI. Seriously. Give yourself a pat on the back.

## How deep should you go?

Mastering attention in detail demands linear algebra, calculus, probability, and GPU-level coding. For **most** practitioners, the high-level intuition above is enough to guide practical optimization: flip on FlashAttention, use KV-cache quantization, and watch your throughput rise. Diving further is worthwhile mainly if you're studying for a deep-learning exam or implementing kernels yourself—otherwise it can lead to the classic trap of *confusion mixed with overconfidence*.

Here's my practical advice for the curious bunch among the readers: 

- Try to understand the intuition first.  
- Try digging deeper if you're interested.
- At least try to understand it ONCE.
- Then, forget about it and move on.

The point is, unless you come from years of battle-tested math and computing background, your understanding, which is not so solid to begin with, will not stick. It will trip you up over and over again.  

## Key takeaways

Focus on intuitive understanding, and never forget that intuition. 

From the object-oriented perspective:

- Create a nugget of understanding of the attention mechanism.
- Add polymorphism if you need to adapt to different concepts like FlashAttention, KV-cache, etc. 
- Encapsulate everything still hampering your progress into a black box, until the day something really clicks.

Perfect is the enemy of done. 

I myself don't claim I fully understand what the heck is going on in those neural networks of LLMs. 

But, can anyone? Even those godfathers of deep learning say they don't. 

If one says they do, they are either still confused or... more seriously, overconfident.
