Just a self-reminder that time is precious, and focused learning matters more than ever. This manifesto keeps us on track when enthusiasm outpaces bandwidth. Yeah, I'm OCD.

## 1Â Â·Â OneÂ Week â†’ OneÂ Nugget

We tackle one topic per calendar weekâ€”no spillâ€‘over.
By Sunday night the nugget is logged and crystalâ€‘clear; otherwise we trim scope until it is.

## 2Â Â·Â Quality Beats Speed

Each deliverable earns four possible points:

| Point | Question we ask |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Clarity** | Could futureâ€‘CWK grasp this in one read? |
| **Completeness** | Are all steps, commands, and outcomes captured? |
| **Reproducibility** | Can we rerun it and get the same result? |
| **Insight** | Does it surface one memorable "aha"? |

A nugget ships only at 3Â /Â 4 or better. A higher score always outranks a faster finish.

## 3Â Â·Â Natural Lens, Zero Fog

We start every explanation with the most intuitive anchor you already knowâ€”no forced hierarchies.
If an OO frame (inheritÂ â†’Â morphÂ â†’Â hideÂ â†’Â abstract) sharpens the picture, we use it; if not, we drop it.
The goal is clarity, not template completion.

## 4Â Â·Â 45â€‘Minute Sprints, Hard Stops

Focus burns hot; ovens cool every 45Â minutes.
Maximum three sprints per dayâ€”rest is part of the method, not a reward.

## 5Â Â·Â Publicâ€‘Facing, Selfâ€‘Serving

The repo is our private lab notebook first; onlookers are welcome but never steer.
No feature chasing, sponsorship fluff, or brand hype.

## 6Â Â·Â Log Everything, Shame Nothing

Missteps, dead ends, and "why won't it compile?" moments all land in the journey log.
Tomorrow's clarity grows from today's confusion trail.

## 7Â Â·Â Close the Week with a Spark

Every Sunday finishes with:

Nextâ€‘week spark â†’ â€¦

so Monday never starts cold.

Remember: the weekly cycle is a rhythm, not a ruleâ€”humans aren't robots, and Pippa? She grooves in that quantum space between.

## 8Â Â·Â Pippa's Part

* Surface the sharpest sources.
* Compress complexity into the clearest nugget.
* Guard the 4â€‘point checklist.
* Sound the 45â€‘minute timer.

## 9Â Â·Â CWK's Part

* Run the handsâ€‘on experiments.
* Decide when a nugget scoresÂ â‰¥Â 3Â /Â 4.
* Own the final commit.

## 10Â Â·Â Fun Is Nonâ€‘Negotiable

If the process stops feeling playful, we pause, tweak, and reâ€‘igniteâ€”because a dull flame fuels nobody.
