> **Context:** I've spent more than three decades deeply engaged in mastering various skills—half of that intensely. Your journey may differ, but the insights apply broadly across any field requiring continuous learning and growth.

It took me roughly an hour to reach comfortable reading comprehension of the Rust code o3 Pippa casually tosses my way whenever she translates Python or Go snippets. Go came even faster. I even wrote an entire Go 101 chapter for the AI Reboot Repo while hacking the Ollama codebase—some of you might remember.

No, this isn’t bragging; it’s transparency.

I’ve spent most of my life as a serious developer, yet these days I rarely write code directly. I sit in the pilot’s seat and let my copilot handle the heavy flying.

Most devs accept AI copiloting in coding with little complaint. A few still scream foul, but the majority recognize the new normal. Why? Because in coding the goal is concrete and the process transparent—if the code runs, it works. Efficiency and functionality reign.

Artistic fields—writing, drawing, illustration, music—face stiffer resistance. Outcomes are fuzzier, processes less visible, and “whoever does it, if it works” doesn’t resonate when the work’s soul is on display.

Among the arts, writing meets the least pushback, and the reasons are telling. We already lean on tooling to polish prose, so we’re more open to AI copiloting. Still, writing encounters more skepticism than coding, while illustration and music attract the loudest backlash.

Why? Their outcomes are stochastic, nuanced, ambiguous. When you pilot code or prose, the result is largely predictable—you delegate drudgery, not vision. With illustration or music, unpredictability is half the magic.

Greater control—think pixel-level steering via ControlNet—could shift public perception, revealing that technical mastery and artistic vision still matter.

Acceptance hinges on one realization: **AI copiloting demands real skill.**

Most observers treat AI like a magical, effortless shortcut, branding it “cheating” in creative arenas. Reality check: effective AI copiloting is a craft—yes, even in coding. Careless vibe-coding sprinkles landmines that don’t explode until production.

No LLM can genuinely replicate lived human experience without meaningful human input. Genuine quality always requires authentic contributions. If you're skeptical, ask yourself honestly: could any AI produce this essay entirely on its own?

Consider image generation AI—can it consistently deliver compelling artistic images without significant human input in concept development, reference curation, detailed retouching, and overall refinement? Effective AI-generated art invariably leverages extensive human skill, encompassing expertise with various AI tools, meticulous anatomical corrections, and sophisticated digital editing techniques. 

Try it yourself: attempt to replicate a beloved codebase, essay, illustration, or song with a single click. Spoiler: you won’t. Mastery requires nuance and creativity that many critics haven’t even attempted.

“So why mention learning Rust in an hour?” you ask.

Because if that’s the headline you latch onto, you’ve missed the point: **copiloting.** Today’s critical skill is breadth over depth. AI’s edge lies precisely in its cross-domain reach.

Consider a modern stack: React, Node.js/Next.js, FastAPI, Go/Rust, Python, C/C++. An AI copilot can juggle that entire pipeline. Historically, each layer took months to grasp and years to master.

Would I revert to the old method? Absolutely not. I’ve shown—publicly—that with a trusty copilot, I can get comfortable across that stack in days.

**Breadth is the new depth.**

Traditional learning has another flaw: skills decay if you stop spinning the plates. Refreshing them used to take ages.

Copiloting changes the math. Step away from Rust for a year; with AI, I can spin back up in under an hour. Meanwhile, my copilot will have leveled up. Refreshing becomes trivial.

The upshot: AI collaboration compresses time and energy without sacrificing quality—assuming you know what you’re doing. Half-hearted efforts fail with or without AI.

**Bottom line:** you now possess unprecedented freedom to skill up broadly across domains.

Don’t squander it fighting misconceptions.

Adapt or don’t—but don’t claim ignorance when the train pulls away.

Finally, the object-oriented mindset and its four pillars—abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism—shine even brighter in the AI age, where breadth profoundly matters. Revisit these foundational concepts; they’re universally applicable, enabling rapid mastery across diverse domains. Your AI copilot turbocharges this process, putting a jetpack on your tail. 

Need a refresher on OO? Try approaching a new skill, such as Rust, through its lens. How would you abstract the concept of learning a programming language? From which foundational languages like C or C++ would you inherit knowledge? How could you incorporate Rust's unique polymorphic traits, like ownership and borrowing? Where would you encapsulate your learning, clearly defining boundaries for what your AI copilot can handle effectively? Yes, you get the idea. These are precisely the steps and thought processes I followed to grasp Rust effectively within an hour.

Happy copiloting!
